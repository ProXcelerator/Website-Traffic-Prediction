# Website-Traffic-Prediction  
 
## Project Overview:  
The main goal of this project is to look at website recipes and try to make a prediction model that accuratly predicts high traffic 80% of the time.  

## Business goals:  
Being able to predict if a recipe is high traffic or not would potentialy lead to better customer retention and possibly new customers getting subscriptions. Also looking at what recipes perform well will tell us if we should continue to make those recipes or not.  

## Data:
The dataset contains 947 rows of uncleaned data with 8 columns-   
**recipe #** - unique recipe identifier  
**calories** - float  
**carbohydrates** - float, carbs in grams  
**sugar** - float, sugar in grams  
**protein** - float, protein in grams  
**category** - object, 10 unique types of food
